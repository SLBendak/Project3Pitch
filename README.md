### Project Overview:
Our application will be a hiking app, providing a user with an opportunity to organize their hiking options. 

### Models
- User
- Trails

- Schemas
- User
	Name
	Email
	Password
	Location
	Radius from trail
	Nickname (optional)
{Favorite_trails
		API ID}
- Trails
	Id
	TrailName
	Location
	API ID

### User Stories

A user can log in and create an account, they will add to their account a location and a radius from that location to return trails.
-create user,
-return user 
-update location and/or radius
-delete nickname
	
Then the user can see trails for their parameters utilizing our api.
A user can select a trail to view details. On this page they can “fave”.
Favoriting the document will create a reference in the user’s account.
	-”create”: with adding a favorite.
	-”read”:  view all favorites?
	-”update”: search location
	-”delete”: remove a favorite
A user can save trails to their account.
The user can see their favorite trails on their profile.
